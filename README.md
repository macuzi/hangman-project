# Hangman Game

A classic word guessing game implemented in JS.

## Description

Hangman is a word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game ends when either the player guesses the word correctly or the hanging man drawing is completed (indicating the player has lost).

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined dictionary
- Visual representation of the hangman
- Letter tracking (used and available letters)
- Score tracking
- Multiple difficulty levels

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/macuzi/hangman-project

```

## How to Play

4. If the letter is in the word, the underscores will be replaced with the letter

6. Continue guessing until you either guess the word or the hangman is completed
