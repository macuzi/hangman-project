## Deployed Project here â†’ https://macuzi.github.io/hangman-project/

A classic word guessing game implemented in HTML/JS/CANVAS API.

## Description

Hangman is a word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hanging man is drawn. The game ends when either the player guesses the word correctly or the hanging man drawing is completed (indicating the player has lost).

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined dictionary
- Visual representation of the hangman
- Letter tracking (used and available letters)
- Lives tracking

git clone https://github.com/macuzi/hangman-project

```

## How to Play

4. If the letter is in the word, the underscores will be replaced with the letter
